            <h2>PNLE V for Care of Clients with Physiologic and Psychosocial Alterations
                (Part 3)</h2>
            <p>
                1. Mr. Marquez reports of losing his job, not being able to sleep at night, and
                feeling upset with his wife. Nurse John responds to the client, “You may want to
                talk about your employment situation in group today.” The Nurse is using which
                therapeutic technique?
                <br>
                <strong>
                    Focusing. The nurse is using focusing by suggesting that the client discuss a
                    specific issue. The nurse didn’t restate the question, make observation, or ask
                    further question (exploring).
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                2. Tony refuses his evening dose of Haloperidol (Haldol), then becomes extremely
                agitated in the dayroom while other clients are watching television. He begins
                cursing and throwing furniture. Nurse Oliver first action is to:
                <br>
                <strong>
                    Remove all other clients from the dayroom. The nurse’s first priority is to
                    consider the safety of the clients in the therapeutic setting. The other actions
                    are appropriate responses after ensuring the safety of other clients.
                </strong>

                3. Tina who is manic, but not yet on medication, comes to the drug treatment
                center. The nurse would not let this client join the group session because:
                <br>
                <strong>
                    The client is disruptive. Group activity provides too much stimulation, which
                    the client will not be able to handle (harmful to self) and as a result will be
                    disruptive to others.
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                4. Dervid, an adolescent boy was admitted for substance abuse and
                hallucinations. The client’s mother asks Nurse Armando to talk with his husband
                when he arrives at the hospital. The mother says that she is afraid of what the
                father might say to the boy. The most appropriate nursing intervention would be
                to:
                <br>
                <strong>
                    Agree to talk with the mother and the father together. By agreeing to talk with
                    both parents, the nurse can provide emotional support and further assess and
                    validate the family’s needs.
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                5. What is Nurse John likely to note in a male client being admitted for alcohol
                withdrawal?
                <br>
                <strong>
                    Perceptual disorders. Frightening visual hallucinations are especially common in
                    clients experiencing alcohol withdrawal.
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                6. Aira has taken amitriptyline HCL (Elavil) for 3 days, but now complains that
                it “doesn’t help” and refuses to take it. What should the nurse say or do?
                <br>
                <strong>
                    Suggest that it takes awhile before seeing the results. The client needs a
                    specific response; that it takes 2 to 3 weeks (a delayed effect) until the
                    therapeutic blood level is reached.
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                7. Dervid, an adolescent has a history of truancy from school, running away from
                home and “barrowing” other people’s things without their permission. The
                adolescent denies stealing, rationalizing instead that as long as no one was
                using the items, it was all right to borrow them. It is important for the nurse
                to understand the psychodynamically, this behavior may be largely attributed to
                a developmental defect related to the:
                <br>
                <strong>
                    Superego. This behavior shows a weak sense of moral consciousness. According to
                    Freudian theory, personality disorders stem from a weak superego.
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                8. In preparing a female client for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), Nurse
                Michelle knows that succinylcoline (Anectine) will be administered for which
                therapeutic effect?
                <br>
                <strong>
                    Skeletal muscle paralysis. Anectine is a depolarizing muscle relaxant causing
                    paralysis. It is used to reduce the intensity of muscle contractions during the
                    convulsive stage, thereby reducing the risk of bone fractures or dislocation.

            <p>
                9. Nurse Gina is aware that the dietary implications for a client in manic phase
                of bipolar disorder is:
                <br>
                <strong>
                    Increase calories, carbohydrates, and protein.This client increased protein for
                    tissue building and increased calories to replace what is burned up (usually via
                    carbohydrates).
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                10.What parental behavior toward a child during an admission procedure should
                cause Nurse Ron to suspect child abuse?
                <br>
                <strong>
                    Acting overly solicitous toward the child. This behavior is an example of
                    reaction formation, a coping mechanism.
                </strong>
            </p>

                11.Nurse Lynnette notices that a female client with obsessive-compulsive
                disorder washes her hands for long periods each day. How should the nurse
                respond to this compulsive behavior?
                <br>
                <strong>
                    By designating times during which the client can focus on the behavior. The
                    nurse should designate times during which the client can focus on the compulsive
                    behavior or obsessive thoughts. The nurse should urge the client to reduce the
                    frequency of the compulsive behavior gradually, not rapidly. She shouldn’t call
                    attention to or try to prevent the behavior. Trying to prevent the behavior may
                    cause pain and terror in the client. The nurse should encourage the client to
                    verbalize anxieties to help distract attention from the compulsive behavior.
                </strong>

                12.After seeking help at an outpatient mental health clinic, Ruby who was raped
                while walking her dog is diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
                Three months later, Ruby returns to the clinic, complaining of fear, loss of
                control, and helpless feelings. Which nursing intervention is most appropriate
                for Ruby?
                <br>
                <strong>
                    Exploring the meaning of the traumatic event with the client. The client with
                    PTSD needs encouragement to examine and understand the meaning of the traumatic
                    event and consequent losses. Otherwise, symptoms may worsen and the client may
                    become depressed or engage in self-destructive behavior such as substance abuse.
                    The client must explore the meaning of the event and won’t heal without this, no
                    matter how much time passes. Behavioral techniques, such as relaxation therapy,
                    may help decrease the client’s anxiety and induce sleep. The physician may
                    prescribe antianxiety agents or antidepressants cautiously to avoid dependence;
                    sleep medication is rarely appropriate. A special diet isn’t indicated unless
                    the client also has an eating disorder or a nutritional problem.

                13.Meryl, age 19, is highly dependent on her parents and fears leaving home to
                go away to college. Shortly before the semester starts, she complains that her
                legs are paralyzed and is rushed to the emergency department. When physical
                examination rules out a physical cause for her paralysis, the physician admits
                her to the psychiatric unit where she is diagnosed with conversion disorder.
                Meryl asks the nurse, “Why has this happened to me?” What is the nurse’s best
                response?
                <br>
                <strong>
                    “Your problem is real but there is no physical basis for it. We’ll work on what
                    is going on in your life to find out why it’s happened.” The nurse must be
                    honest with the client by telling her that the paralysis has no physiologic
                    cause while also conveying empathy and acknowledging that her symptoms are real.
                    The client will benefit from psychiatric treatment, which will help her
                    understand the underlying cause of her symptoms. After the psychological
                    conflict is resolved, her symptoms will disappear. Saying that it must be awful
                    not to be able to move her legs wouldn’t answer the client’s question; knowing
                    that the cause is psychological wouldn’t necessarily make her feel better.
                    Telling her that she has developed paralysis to avoid leaving her parents or
                    that her personality caused her disorder wouldn’t help her understand and
                    resolve the underlying conflict.

                14.Nurse Krina knows that the following drugs have been known to be effective in
                treating obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD):
                <br>
                <strong>
                    fluvoxamine (Luvox) and clomipramine (Anafranil). The antidepressants
                    fluvoxamine and clomipramine have been effective in the treatment of OCD.
                    Librium and Valium may be helpful in treating anxiety related to OCD but aren’t
                    drugs of choice to treat the illness. The other medications mentioned aren’t
                    effective in the treatment of OCD.

                15.Alfred was newly diagnosed with anxiety disorder. The physician prescribed
                buspirone (BuSpar). The nurse is aware that the teaching instructions for newly
                prescribed buspirone should include which of the following?
                <br>
                <strong>
                    A warning about the drugs delayed therapeutic effect, which is from 14 to 30
                    days. The client should be informed that the drug’s therapeutic effect might not
                    be reached for 14 to 30 days. The client must be instructed to continue taking
                    the drug as directed. Blood level checks aren’t necessary. NMS hasn’t been
                    reported with this drug, but tachycardia is frequently reported.
