                1. The nurse In-charge in labor and delivery unit administered a dose of
                terbutaline to a client without checking the client’s pulse. The standard that
                would be used to determine if the nurse was negligent is:
                <br>
                <strong>The actions of a reasonably prudent nurse with similar education and
                    experience. The standard of care is determined by the average degree of skill,
                    care, and diligence by nurses in similar circumstances.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                2. Nurse Trish is caring for a female client with a history of GI bleeding,
                sickle cell disease, and a platelet count of 22,000/μl. The female client is
                dehydrated and receiving dextrose 5% in half-normal saline solution at 150
                ml/hr. The client complains of severe bone pain and is scheduled to receive a
                dose of morphine sulfate. In administering the medication, Nurse Trish should
                avoid which route?
                <br>
                <strong>I.M. With a platelet count of 22,000/μl, the clients tends to bleed
                    easily. Therefore, the nurse should avoid using the I.M. route because the area
                    is a highly vascular and can bleed readily when penetrated by a needle. The
                    bleeding can be difficult to stop.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                3. Dr. Garcia writes the following order for the client who has been recently
                admitted “Digoxin .125 mg P.O. once daily.” To prevent a dosage error, how
                should the nurse document this order onto the medication administration record?
                <br>
                <strong>“Digoxin 0.125 mg P.O. once daily” The nurse should always place a zero
                    before a decimal point so that no one misreads the figure, which could result in
                    a dosage error. The nurse should never insert a zero at the end of a dosage that
                    includes a decimal point because this could be misread, possibly leading to a
                    tenfold increase in the dosage.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                4. A newly admitted female client was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis. Which
                nursing diagnosis should receive the highest priority?
                <br>
                <strong>Ineffective peripheral tissue perfusion related to venous congestion.
                    Ineffective peripheral tissue perfusion related to venous congestion takes the
                    highest priority because venous inflammation and clot formation impede blood
                    flow in a client with deep vein thrombosis.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                5. Nurse Betty is assigned to the following clients. The client that the nurse
                would see first after endorsement?
                <br>
                <strong>A 44 year-old myocardial infarction (MI) client who is complaining of
                    nausea. Nausea is a symptom of impending myocardial infarction (MI) and should
                    be assessed immediately so that treatment can be instituted and further damage
                    to the heart is avoided.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                6. Nurse Gail places a client in a four-point restraint following orders from
                the physician. The client care plan should include:
                <br>
                <strong>Check circulation every 15-30 minutes. Restraints encircle the limbs,
                    which place the client at risk for circulation being restricted to the distal
                    areas of the extremities. Checking the client’s circulation every 15-30 minutes
                    will allow the nurse to adjust the restraints before injury from decreased blood
                    flow occurs.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                7. A male client who has severe burns is receiving H2 receptor antagonist
                therapy. The nurse In-charge knows the purpose of this therapy is to:
                <br>
                <strong>Prevent stress ulcer. Curling’s ulcer occurs as a generalized stress
                    response in burn patients. This results in a decreased production of mucus and
                    increased secretion of gastric acid. The best treatment for this prophylactic
                    use of antacids and H2 receptor blockers.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                8. The doctor orders hourly urine output measurement for a postoperative male
                client. The nurse Trish records the following amounts of output for 2
                consecutive hours: 8 a.m.: 50 ml; 9 a.m.: 60 ml. Based on these amounts, which
                action should the nurse take?
                <br>
                <strong>Continue to monitor and record hourly urine output. Normal urine output
                    for an adult is approximately 1 ml/minute (60 ml/hour). Therefore, this client’s
                    output is normal. Beyond continued evaluation, no nursing action is warranted.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                9. Tony, a basketball player twist his right ankle while playing on the court
                and seeks care for ankle pain and swelling. After the nurse applies ice to the
                ankle for 30 minutes, which statement by Tony suggests that ice application has
                been effective?
                <br>
                <strong>“My ankle looks less swollen now”. Ice application decreases pain and
                    swelling. Continued or increased pain, redness, and increased warmth are signs
                    of inflammation that shouldn’t occur after ice application</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                10.The physician prescribes a loop diuretic for a client. When administering
                this drug, the nurse anticipates that the client may develop which electrolyte
                imbalance?
                <br>
                <strong>Hyperkalemia. A loop diuretic removes water and, along with it, sodium
                    and potassium. This may result in hypokalemia, hypovolemia, and hyponatremia.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>11.She finds out that some managers have benevolent-authoritative style of
                management. Which of the following behaviors will she exhibit most likely?
                <br>
                <strong>Have condescending trust and confidence in their subordinates.
                    Benevolent-authoritative managers pretentiously show their trust and confidence
                    to their followers.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>12. Nurse Amy is aware that the following is true about functional nursing.
                <br>
                <strong>Provides continuous, coordinated and comprehensive nursing services.
                    Functional nursing is focused on tasks and activities and not on the care of the
                    patients.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>13.Which type of medication order might read “Vitamin K 10 mg I.M. daily × 3
                days?”
                <br>
                <strong>Standard written order. This is a standard written order. Prescribers
                    write a single order for medications given only once. A stat order is written
                    for medications given immediately for an urgent client problem. A standing
                    order, also known as a protocol, establishes guidelines for treating a
                    particular disease or set of symptoms in special care areas such as the coronary
                    care unit. Facilities also may institute medication protocols that specifically
                    designate drugs that a nurse may not give.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>14.A female client with a fecal impaction frequently exhibits which clinical
                manifestation?
                <br>
                <strong>Liquid or semi-liquid stools. Passage of liquid or semi-liquid stools
                    results from seepage of unformed bowel contents around the impacted stool in the
                    rectum. Clients with fecal impaction don’t pass hard, brown, formed stools
                    because the feces can’t move past the impaction. These clients typically report
                    the urge to defecate (although they can’t pass stool) and a decreased appetite.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>15.Nurse Linda prepares to perform an otoscopic examination on a female
                client. For proper visualization, the nurse should position the client’s ear by:
                <br>
                <strong>Pulling the helix up and back. To perform an otoscopic examination on an
                    adult, the nurse grasps the helix of the ear and pulls it up and back to
                    straighten the ear canal. For a child, the nurse grasps the helix and pulls it
                    down to straighten the ear canal. Pulling the lobule in any direction wouldn’t
                    straighten the ear canal for visualization.</strong>
