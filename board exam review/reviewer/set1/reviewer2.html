            <h1>PNLE II for Community Health Nursing and Care of the Mother and Child</h1>
            <p>
                1. May arrives at the health care clinic and tells the nurse that her last
                menstrual period was 9 weeks ago. She also tells the nurse that a home pregnancy
                test was positive but she began to have mild cramps and is now having moderate
                vaginal bleeding. During the physical examination of the client, the nurse notes
                that May has a dilated cervix. The nurse determines that May is experiencing
                which type of abortion?<br>
                <strong>Inevitable. An inevitable abortion is termination of pregnancy that
                    cannot be prevented. Moderate to severe bleeding with mild cramping and cervical
                    dilation would be noted in this type of abortion.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                2. Nurse Reese is reviewing the record of a pregnant client for her first
                prenatal visit. Which of the following data, if noted on the client’s record,
                would alert the nurse that the client is at risk for a spontaneous abortion?<br>
                <strong>History of syphilis. Maternal infections such as syphilis,
                    toxoplasmosis, and rubella are causes of spontaneous abortion.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                3. Nurse Hazel is preparing to care for a client who is newly admitted to the
                hospital with a possible diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy. Nurse Hazel develops a
                plan of care for the client and determines that which of the following nursing
                actions is the priority?<br>
                <strong>Monitoring apical pulse. Nursing care for the client with a possible
                    ectopic pregnancy is focused on preventing or identifying hypovolemic shock and
                    controlling pain. An elevated pulse rate is an indicator of shock.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                4. Nurse Oliver is teaching a diabetic pregnant client about nutrition and
                insulin needs during pregnancy. The nurse determines that the client understands
                dietary and insulin needs if the client states that the second half of pregnancy
                require:<br>
                <strong>Increased caloric intake. Glucose crosses the placenta, but insulin does
                    not. High fetal demands for glucose, combined with the insulin resistance caused
                    by hormonal changes in the last half of pregnancy can result in elevation of
                    maternal blood glucose levels. This increases the mother’s demand for insulin
                    and is referred to as the diabetogenic effect of pregnancy.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                5. Nurse Michelle is assessing a 24 year old client with a diagnosis of
                hydatidiform mole. She is aware that one of the following is unassociated with
                this condition?<br>
                <strong>Excessive fetal activity. The most common signs and symptoms of
                    hydatidiform mole includes elevated levels of human chorionic gonadotropin,
                    vaginal bleeding, larger than normal uterus for gestational age, failure to
                    detect fetal heart activity even with sensitive instruments, excessive nausea
                    and vomiting, and early development of pregnancy-induced hypertension. Fetal
                    activity would not be noted.
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                6. A pregnant client is receiving magnesium sulfate for severe pregnancy induced
                hypertension (PIH). The clinical findings that would warrant use of the antidote
                , calcium gluconate is:<br>
                <strong>Absent patellar reflexes. Absence of patellar reflexes is an indicator
                    of hypermagnesemia, which requires administration of calcium gluconate.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                7. During vaginal examination of Janah who is in labor, the presenting part is
                at station plus two. Nurse, correctly interprets it as:<br>
                <strong>Presenting part in 2 cm below the plane of the ischial spines. Fetus at
                    station plus two indicates that the presenting part is 2 cm below the plane of
                    the ischial spines.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                8. A pregnant client is receiving oxytocin (Pitocin) for induction of labor. A
                condition that warrant the nurse in-charge to discontinue I.V. infusion of
                Pitocin is:<br>
                <strong>Contractions every 1 ½ minutes lasting 70-80 seconds. Contractions every
                    1 ½ minutes lasting 70-80 seconds, is indicative of hyperstimulation of the
                    uterus, which could result in injury to the mother and the fetus if Pitocin is
                    not discontinued.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                9. Calcium gluconate is being administered to a client with pregnancy induced
                hypertension (PIH). A nursing action that must be initiated as the plan of care
                throughout injection of the drug is:<br>
                <strong>EKG tracings. A potential side effect of calcium gluconate
                    administration is cardiac arrest. Continuous monitoring of cardiac activity
                    (EKG) throught administration of calcium gluconate is an essential part of care.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                10. A trial for vaginal delivery after an earlier caesareans, would likely to be
                given to a gravida, who had:<br>
                <strong>First low transverse caesarean was for breech position. Fetus in this
                    pregnancy is in a vertex presentation. This type of client has no obstetrical
                    indication for a caesarean section as she did with her first caesarean delivery.</strong>
