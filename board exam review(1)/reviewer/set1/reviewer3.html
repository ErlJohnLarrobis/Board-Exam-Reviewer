            <h2>PNLE III for Care of Clients with Physiologic and Psychosocial Alterations
                (Part 1)</h2>
            <p>1. Nurse Michelle should know that the drainage is normal 4 days after a
                sigmoid colostomy when the stool is:
                <br>
                <strong>
                    Loose, bloody. Normal bowel function and soft-formed stool usually do not occur
                    until around the seventh day following surgery. The stool consistency is related
                    to how much water is being absorbed.
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>2. Where would nurse Kristine place the call light for a male client with a
                right-sided brain attack and left homonymous hemianopsia?
                <br>
                <strong>
                    On the client’s right side. The client has left visual field blindness. The
                    client will see only from the right side.
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>3. A male client is admitted to the emergency department following an
                accident. What are the first nursing actions of the nurse?
                <br>
                <strong>
                    Check respirations, stabilize spine, and check circulation. Checking the airway
                    would be priority, and a neck injury should be suspected.
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>4. In evaluating the effect of nitroglycerin, Nurse Arthur should know that
                it reduces preload and relieves angina by:
                <br>
                <strong>
                    Decreasing venous return through vasodilation. The significant effect of
                    nitroglycerin is vasodilation and decreased venous return, so the heart does not
                    have to work hard.
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>5. Nurse Patricia finds a female client who is post-myocardial infarction
                (MI) slumped on the side rails of the bed and unresponsive to shaking or
                shouting. Which is the nurse next action?
                <br>
                <strong>
                    Call for help and note the time. Having established, by stimulating the client,
                    that the client is unconscious rather than sleep, the nurse should immediately
                    call for help. This may be done by dialing the operator from the client’s phone
                    and giving the hospital code for cardiac arrest and the client’s room number to
                    the operator, of if the phone is not available, by pulling the emergency call
                    button. Noting the time is important baseline information for cardiac arrest
                    procedure.
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>6. Nurse Monett is caring for a client recovering from gastro-intestinal
                bleeding. The nurse should:
                <br>
                <strong>
                    Make sure that the client takes food and medications at prescribed intervals.
                    Food and drug therapy will prevent the accumulation of hydrochloric acid, or
                    will neutralize and buffer the acid that does accumulate.
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>7. A male client was on warfarin (Coumadin) before admission, and has been
                receiving heparin I.V. for 2 days. The partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is 68
                seconds. What should Nurse Carla do?
                <br>
                <strong>
                    Continue treatment as ordered. The effects of heparin are monitored by the PTT
                    is normally 30 to 45 seconds; the therapeutic level is 1.5 to 2 times the normal
                    level.
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>8. A client undergone ileostomy, when should the drainage appliance be
                applied to the stoma?
                <br>
                <strong>
                    In the operating room. The stoma drainage bag is applied in the operating room.
                    Drainage from the ileostomy contains secretions that are rich in digestive
                    enzymes and highly irritating to the skin. Protection of the skin from the
                    effects of these enzymes is begun at once. Skin exposed to these enzymes even
                    for a short time becomes reddened, painful, and excoriated.
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>9. A client undergone spinal anesthetic, it will be important that the nurse
                immediately position the client in:
                <br>
                <strong>
                    Flat on back. To avoid the complication of a painful spinal headache that can
                    last for several days, the client is kept in flat in a supine position for
                    approximately 4 to 12 hours postoperatively. Headaches are believed to be causes
                    by the seepage of cerebral spinal fluid from the puncture site. By keeping the
                    client flat, cerebral spinal fluid pressures are equalized, which avoids trauma
                    to the neurons.
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>10.While monitoring a male client several hours after a motor vehicle
                accident, which assessment data suggest increasing intracranial pressure?
                <br>
                <strong>
                    The client is oriented when aroused from sleep, and goes back to sleep
                    immediately. This finding suggest that the level of consciousness is decreasing.
                </strong>

            <p>11.Mrs. Cruz, 80 years old is diagnosed with pneumonia. Which of the
                following symptoms may appear first?
                <br>
                <strong>
                    Altered mental status and dehydration. Fever, chills, hemortysis, dyspnea,
                    cough, and pleuritic chest pain are the common symptoms of pneumonia, but
                    elderly clients may first appear with only an altered lentil status and
                    dehydration due to a blunted immune response.
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>12. A male client has active tuberculosis (TB). Which of the following
                symptoms will be exhibit?
                <br>
                <strong>
                    Chills, fever, night sweats, and hemoptysis. Typical signs and symptoms are
                    chills, fever, night sweats, and hemoptysis. Chest pain may be present from
                    coughing, but isn’t usual. Clients with TB typically have low-grade fevers, not
                    higher than 102°F (38.9°C). Nausea, headache, and photophobia aren’t usual TB
                    symptoms.
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>13. Mark, a 7-year-old client is brought to the emergency department. He’s
                tachypneic and afebrile and has a respiratory rate of 36 breaths/minute and has
                a nonproductive cough. He recently had a cold. Form this history; the client may
                have which of the following conditions?
                <br>
                <strong>
                    Acute asthma. Based on the client’s history and symptoms, acute asthma is the
                    most likely diagnosis. He’s unlikely to have bronchial pneumonia without a
                    productive cough and fever and he’s too young to have developed (COPD) and
                    emphysema.
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>14. Marichu was given morphine sulfate for pain. She is sleeping and her
                respiratory rate is 4 breaths/minute. If action isn’t taken quickly, she might
                have which of the following reactions?
                <br>
                <strong>
                    Respiratory arrest. Narcotics can cause respiratory arrest if given in large
                    quantities. It’s unlikely the client will have asthma attack or a seizure or
                    wake up on his own.
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>15. A 77-year-old male client is admitted for elective knee surgery. Physical
                examination reveals shallow respirations but no sign of respiratory distress.
                Which of the following is a normal physiologic change related to aging?
                <br>
                <strong>
                    Decreased vital capacity. Reduction in vital capacity is a normal physiologic
                    changes include decreased elastic recoil of the lungs, fewer functional
                    capillaries in the alveoli, and an increased in residual volume.
