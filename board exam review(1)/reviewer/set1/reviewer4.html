            <h2>PNLE IV for Care of Clients with Physiologic and Psychosocial Alterations
                (Part 2)</h2>
            <p>
                1. Randy has undergone kidney transplant, what assessment would prompt Nurse
                Katrina to suspect organ rejection?
                <br>
                <strong>
                    Hypertension. Hypertension, along with fever, and tenderness over the grafted
                    kidney, reflects acute rejection.
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                2. The immediate objective of nursing care for an overweight, mildly
                hypertensive male client with ureteral colic and hematuria is to decrease:
                <br>
                <strong>
                    Pain. Sharp, severe pain (renal colic) radiating toward the genitalia and thigh
                    is caused by urethral distention and smooth muscle spasm; relief form pain is
                    the priority.
                </strong>

                3. Matilda, with hyperthyroidism is to receive Lugol’s iodine solution before a
                subtotal thyroidectomy is performed. The nurse is aware that this medication is
                given to:
                <br>
                <strong>
                    Decrease the size and vascularity of the thyroid gland. Lugol’s solution
                    provides iodine, which aids in decreasing the vascularity of the thyroid gland,
                    which limits the risk of hemorrhage when surgery is performed.
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                4. Ricardo, was diagnosed with type I diabetes. The nurse is aware that acute
                hypoglycemia also can develop in the client who is diagnosed with:
                <br>
                <strong>
                    Liver Disease. The client with liver disease has a decreased ability to
                    metabolize carbohydrates because of a decreased ability to form glycogen
                    (glycogenesis) and to form glucose from glycogen.
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                5. Tracy is receiving combination chemotherapy for treatment of metastatic
                carcinoma. Nurse Ruby should monitor the client for the systemic side effect of:
                <br>
                <strong>
                    Leukopenia. Leukopenia, a reduction in WBCs, is a systemic effect of
                    chemotherapy as a result of myelosuppression.
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                6. Norma, with recent colostomy expresses concern about the inability to control
                the passage of gas. Nurse Oliver should suggest that the client plan to:
                <br>
                <strong>
                    Avoid foods that in the past caused flatus. Foods that bothered a person
                    preoperatively will continue to do so after a colostomy.
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                7. Nurse Ron begins to teach a male client how to perform colostomy irrigations.
                The nurse would evaluate that the instructions were understood when the client
                states, “I should:
                <br>
                <strong>
                    Keep the irrigating container less than 18 inches above the stoma.” This height
                    permits the solution to flow slowly with little force so that excessive
                    peristalsis is not immediately precipitated.
                </strong>
            </p>

                8. Patrick is in the oliguric phase of acute tubular necrosis and is
                experiencing fluid and electrolyte imbalances. The client is somewhat confused
                and complains of nausea and muscle weakness. As part of the prescribed therapy
                to correct this electrolyte imbalance, the nurse would expect to:
                <br>
                <strong>
                    Administer Kayexalate. Kayexalate,a potassium exchange resin, permits sodium to
                    be exchanged for potassium in the intestine, reducing the serum potassium level.
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                9. Mario has burn injury. After Forty48 hours, the physician orders for Mario 2
                liters of IV fluid to be administered q12 h. The drop factor of the tubing is 10
                gtt/ml. The nurse should set the flow to provide:
                <br>
                <strong>
                    28 gtt/min. This is the correct flow rate; multiply the amount to be infused
                    (2000 ml) by the drop factor (10) and divide the result by the amount of time in
                    minutes (12 hours x 60 minutes)
                </strong>

                10.Terence suffered form burn injury. Using the rule of nines, which has the
                largest percent of burns?
                <br>
                <strong>
                    Upper trunk. The percentage designated for each burned part of the body using
                    the rule of nines: Head and neck 9%; Right upper extremity 9%; Left upper
                    extremity 9%; Anterior trunk 18%; Posterior trunk 18%; Right lower extremity
                    18%; Left lower extremity 18%; Perineum 1%.

                11. Herbert, a 45 year old construction engineer is brought to the hospital
                unconscious after falling from a 2-story building. When assessing the client,
                the nurse would be most concerned if the assessment revealed:
                <br>
                <strong>
                    Bleeding from ears. The nurse needs to perform a thorough assessment that could
                    indicate alterations in cerebral function, increased intracranial pressures,
                    fractures and bleeding. Bleeding from the ears occurs only with basal skull
                    fractures that can easily contribute to increased intracranial pressure and
                    brain herniation.

                12. Nurse Sherry is teaching male client regarding his permanent artificial
                pacemaker. Which information given by the nurse shows her knowledge deficit
                about the artificial cardiac pacemaker?
                <br>
                <strong>
                    May engage in contact sports. The client should be advised by the nurse to avoid
                    contact sports. This will prevent trauma to the area of the pacemaker generator.
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                13.The nurse is ware that the most relevant knowledge about oxygen
                administration to a male client with COPD is...
                <br>
                <strong>
                    Oxygen at 1-2L/min is given to maintain the hypoxic stimulus for breathing. COPD
                    causes a chronic CO2 retention that renders the medulla insensitive to the CO2
                    stimulation for breathing. The hypoxic state of the client then becomes the
                    stimulus for breathing. Giving the client oxygen in low concentrations will
                    maintain the client’s hypoxic drive.

                14.Tonny has undergoes a left thoracotomy and a partial pneumonectomy. Chest
                tubes are inserted, and one-bottle water-seal drainage is instituted in the
                operating room. In the postanesthesia care unit Tonny is placed in Fowler’s
                position on either his right side or on his back. The nurse is aware that this
                position:
                <br>
                <strong>
                    Facilitate ventilation of the left lung. Since only a partial pneumonectomy is
                    done, there is a need to promote expansion of this remaining Left lung by
                    positioning the client on the opposite unoperated side.
                </strong>

                15.Kristine is scheduled for a bronchoscopy. When teaching Kristine what to
                expect afterward, the nurse’s highest priority of information would be:
                <br>
                <strong>
                    Food and fluids will be withheld for at least 2 hours. Prior to bronchoscopy,
                    the doctors sprays the back of the throat with anesthetic to minimize the gag
                    reflex and thus facilitate the insertion of the bronchoscope. Giving the client
                    food and drink after the procedure without checking on the return of the gag
                    reflex can cause the client to aspirate. The gag reflex usually returns after
                    two hours.
